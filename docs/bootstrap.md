# Bootstrap Servers

[‚Üê Back to Main Documentation](index.md)

Bootstrap servers are computers running Nomicle with public IP addresses that new Nomicle installations can use to discover other Nomicle nodes and help integrate them into the network.

## How to Use Bootstrap Servers

To use these servers, copy and paste any one or two of these addresses into your Nomicle `hosts` file:

- On macOS/Linux: `/usr/local/var/ncle/hosts`
- On Windows: `%APPDATA%\NCLE\hosts.txt`

Make sure each address in the file is on a line of its own.

## Contributing to the Network

At the moment, the only publicly known bootstrap server is the one hosting this website. If you have a computer running Nomicle that is online for long periods of time and would like to help grow the Nomicle network, send us your computer's IP address and the port you've mapped to Nomicle.
